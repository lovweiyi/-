# Introduction




## Load and Process Data

We require three items to in order to conduct our analysis

- RNAseq expression data associated with each patient sample
- Clinical data associated with each patient sample
- Coefficients used in the predictive model

The TCGA data can be accessed from the two packages `RTCGA.clinical` and
`RTCGA.rnaseq`, while the coefficients are those obtained from training our
model on patient G and H.

We will load each of these elements in sequential order, begining with the count
data. The melanoma data from `RTCGA` is found in the object `SKCM.rnaseq`.

```{r}
# get expression data from the RTCGA package
cnt <- as.data.frame(expressionsTCGA(SKCM.rnaseq))
# update rownames to patient identifers
rownames(cnt) <- cnt$bcr_patient_barcode
# remove nun-numeric (and irrelevant) information
cnt$bcr_patient_barcode <- NULL
cnt$dataset <- NULL
# remove samples and genes with 0 expression
cnt <- cnt[rowSums(cnt)> 0 , colSums(cnt)> 0]
```

Before removing any samples based on other conditions, we will also normalize
out data, as necessary to use it as input for the predicitve model. This means
that we will divide each sample by its library size, followed by a division of
each gene by its standard deviation.

```{r}
# get library size
cntSums <- rowSums(cnt)
# divide by library size
cnt <- sweep(cnt,MARGIN = 1,FUN = "/",STATS = cntSums)
# get gene standard deviation
cntStd <- apply(cnt,MARGIN = 2,FUN = sd)
# divide by gene standard deviation
cnt <- sweep(cnt,MARGIN = 2, FUN = "/", STATS =cntStd)
```

The clinical data for the melanoma set is available in the `SKCM.clinical`
object from the `RTCGA.rnaseq` package. The previous study only used
_metastases_ in their analysis, and *not* primary tumors, hence we will filter
the data w.r.t. to this condition. We will also extract survival data from our
meta data, as this is what we are interested in.

```{r}
# access clinical data
mta <- SKCM.clinical
# filter for metastases
mta <- mta[mta$patient.clinical_cqcf.tumor_type == "metastatic",]
# get survival data
survData <- survivalTCGA(mta)
# update rownames to patient identifiers
rownames(survData) <- survData$bcr_patient_barcode
```



```{r}
# the path is set relative to the her2st/scripts folder
coefs.pth <- "/home/alma/Documents/PhD/papers/HER2/her2st/res/TLS-pred/coef-full.tsv.gz"
# read coefs
coefs.ori <- read.table(coefs.pth,sep = '\t',row.names = 1, header = 1)
coefs <- coefs.ori
# store intercept value
intercept <- coefs["intercept",]
```


## Match data

Once all of our data has been loaded, we need to make sure that expression data,
survival data and the coefs are matched. I.e., that rows and columns
represent the same information in all objects (when applicable).

We start by adjusting the patient identifiers in our expression data to be of
the same format as the meta data.

```{r}
# extract 3 first fields of patient identifiers
new.rownames <- sapply(rownames(cnt),
                       function(x){paste(strsplit(x,"-")[[1]][1:3],collapse = "-")})

# convert to characte vector
new.rownames <- as.character(new.rownames)
# check for duplicates
n.duplicates <- sum(duplicated(new.rownames))

if (n.duplicates > 0) {
  sprintf("[WARNING] : %d duplicates found",n.duplicates)
} else {
  sprintf("[INFO] : No duplicates found!")
}
# assign new rownames
rownames(cnt) <- new.rownames
```

We continue to modify the expression data, this time extracting the Gene Symbols
from the compund gene identifiers. The reason for this is to make it compatible
with the model coefficients.

```{r}
# extract gene symbols
new.colnames <- as.character(sapply(colnames(cnt),
                                    function(x) {strsplit(x,"\\|")[[1]][1]}))
# assign new colnames
colnames(cnt) <- new.colnames
```

As a final - and **essential** step before conducting the actual analysis, we
will match the objects. We begin with the model coefficients and the genes in
the expression data.

```{r}
# find genes that are present in both object
inter.genes <- intersect(rownames(coefs),
                         colnames(cnt))
# keep only interecting genes and match order
cnt <- cnt[,inter.genes]
coefs <- coefs[inter.genes,]

```

We then continue by matching the survival data (derived from the clinical meta
data) with the expression data

```{r}
# find identifiers present in both objects
inter.sample <- intersect(rownames(survData),rownames(cnt))
# keep only interecting identifiers and match order
cnt <- cnt[inter.sample,]
survData <- survData[inter.sample,]

```

As a "final touch" we will convert the days given in the survival data into months.

```{r}
# store days in new column
survData$days <- survData$times
# convert time from days to months
survData$times <- survData$times / (365 / 12)
```


## Analysis

Once the data is curated, we may proceed to actually analyze our data.
Naturally, we begin by applying our predictive model you the now normalized
expression data.

The linear model we use surmounts to the following expression

$$
\bar{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \beta_0 \mathbf{1}
$$

Where $\mathbf{X} \in R^{S\times G}$ is the expression matrix [samples x genes],
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is our coefficients, $\beta_0$ represents the intercept,
$\mathbf{1}$ is $S$-dimensional vector of ones, $\bar{\mathbf{y}}$ is evidently
the predeicted TLS-score.

Implementing htis model we have:

```{r}
# predict TLS-score
score <- as.matrix(cnt) %*% coefs + intercept
```

We can also inspect the score distribution to gauge how our values are spread
```{r}
hist(score)
```


Next we will stratify the scores into $5$ different groups, based on on which
which _quintile_ they fall into. We will add this information into the survival
data as well, as it will be our basis for the stratification in the survival
analysis.

```{r}
# compute quintile values
qs <- quantile(score,probs = seq(0,1,0.2))
# get numberic identifiers for quintiles
labels <- seq(length(qs)-1)
# stratify
strat <- cut(score,
             breaks = qs,
             labels = labels,
             include.lowest = TRUE,
             right = FALSE) 

# add to survival data
survData$tls <- strat
```

To mimic the _trichotomization_ described in the reference publication, we will
discard samples that fall in the 2:nd and 4:th quantile, while the remaining
groups are considered as our equivalents to the three groups "low", "high" and
"intermediate".

```{r}
# create map between numeric group and category label
mapper <- c("low","intermediate","high")
names(mapper) <- c("1","3","5")
# subset w.r.t. the three specidied tiers
sub.survData <- survData[survData$tls %in% names(mapper),]
# map numeric values to category
sub.survData$TLS <- mapper[as.character(sub.survData$tls)]
# reorder factors
sub.survData$TLS <- factor(sub.survData$TLS,
                           levels = as.vector(mapper)
                           )
```

Now once the data is stratified, we can conduct the survival analysis and
generate Kaplan-Meier plots. We will use some neat functions from `survminer`
for this purpose.

```{r,fig.width=5,fig.height=5}
# set colors to mimic those of referene publication
color <- c("#F3AC32","#4EC4C7","#BDBDBD")
# make legends
legends <- sapply(as.vector(mapper), function(x){ paste("TLS[",x,"]",collapse = "",sep = "")})
# generate KM-plots, stratify by TLS category
ggsurvplot(
  fit = survfit(Surv(times,patient.vital_status) ~ TLS,
                data=sub.survData),
  ylab = "Overall survival (%)",
  xlab = "Time (months)",
  xlim = c(0,151),
  palette = color,
  break.time.by = 50,
  size = 3,
  censor.size = 1,
  surv.scale = "percent",
  legend.labs = legends,
  pval = TRUE
  )

```

This can then be compared with the results from the reference publication:
